# Changelog: cinewright-edit

Every change to [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) and its companions, newest first, each with the reason. Reasons cite findings in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) (`R-`), lessons in [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md) (`L-`), and test runs in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md) (`T-`). State in `evergreen.json`. Protocol: [MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md).

Entry shape: `### C-YYYYMMDD-n · date · one-line summary`, then `because:`, `files:`, and a sentence on what changed.
