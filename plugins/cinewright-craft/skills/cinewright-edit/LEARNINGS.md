# Learnings: cinewright-edit

Procedural lessons for [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Research findings live in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md); every change is logged in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); test runs in [TESTS.md](TESTS.md); state in `evergreen.json`. Format: [MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md) (LEARNINGS-FORMAT in the evergreen protocol). Retired entries go to LEARNINGS-ARCHIVE.md with a reason.

Write an entry the moment a real signal happens: a user correction, the same error twice, a workaround, an environment fact, a failed test. Check existing entries first: add, update, retire or none. Trigger and Hypothesis are required.

## Active

### L-001 · 2026-10-04 · A multi-shot generation is cut apart by scene detection, then trimmed per part
- Trigger: 2026-10-04, S5 exit check: the S2 render is one 14.375 s generation holding 1A, 1B and 1C, and the cut needed each part's in and out points
- Hypothesis: A model's internal cuts are hard picture changes that ffmpeg's scene score finds reliably at 0.25
- Rule: Run `select='gt(scene,0.25)',showinfo` on a multi-shot take first, treat each part as its own take, and trim inside the parts only
- Evidence: C-20261004-1 (references/cutting-around-bad-frames.md; scene cuts found at 6.000 s and 10.458 s, the cut conformed to 336 frames, 14.000 s), confirmed 2026-10-04

### L-002 · 2026-10-04 · Look at a strip of frames before calling an opening bad frames
- Trigger: 2026-10-04, S5 exit check: the qc rubric flagged 1A bad-opening (the lamp lens glows white from frame 1), which suggested trimming the head
- Hypothesis: Some 'bad openings' are the shot's content, not settle frames, and trimming cannot remove them
- Rule: Make a head strip (first 8 frames, then 2 s at 6 fps) and trim only if the fault ends; if it runs through the shot, send it back to qc as a re-render
- Evidence: C-20261004-1 (references/cutting-around-bad-frames.md Notes; the glow lasted the whole of 1A), confirmed 2026-10-04

### L-003 · 2026-10-04 · Exclude vlogs and live footage in the description
- Trigger: 2026-10-04, S6 matrix T-20261004-2: decoy-3 (cut the ums out of a talking-head vlog in Premiere) invoked the skill Haiku 2 of 3
- Hypothesis: "cutting ... into a film or fixing its pace" reads as any video edit to a small model
- Rule: The Use clause ends "not vlogs or live footage"
- Evidence: C-20261004-2 (description); rerun pending
- Scope: skill

### L-004 · 2026-10-05 · State the edit-or-re-render rule, with the mid-shot case in the body
- Trigger: 2026-10-05, S6 T-20261004-2: outcome-1 (settle frames, a half-second hand melt mid-shot, a whole-shot scar on the wrong side) failed on Sonnet 2 of 3: the melt was treated as a judgment call, and the answer was judged case by case, not a rule
- Hypothesis: Step 2 named head and tail trims and whole-shot faults; the mid-shot cover lived only in the cutting-around-bad-frames reference, which the runs did not read
- Rule: Step 2 covers a fault under 1 s with a cutaway, reaction or cut on action, and states the rule: clean frames to cut to means the edit fixes it
- Evidence: C-20261005-1 (SKILL.md); rerun pending
- Scope: skill
