# Tests: cinewright-edit

Test runs for [SKILL.md](SKILL.md). Cases live in `evals/evals.json`. A failure that taught something is a lesson in [LEARNINGS.md](LEARNINGS.md); a fix it caused is logged in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with `because: T-...`; research it triggered is in [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md); counts are in `evergreen.json` under `tests`. Rules: [MAINTENANCE.md](MAINTENANCE.md) and the evergreen protocol's TESTING.md.

A test passes on evidence (a tool call in the trace, a file, a marker), never on the transcript's claim.

Entry shape: `### T-YYYYMMDD-n · date · harness · env · passed/total`, one line per failing case, then `led to:`. Newest first. Budget 150 lines.

## Runs

### T-20261005-1 · 2026-10-05 · evals/run_evals.py (claude -p --restricted, dontAsk, fresh folder on another drive) · windows/claude-code, Claude Code 2.1.281 · 4/7 cases on all three models
- Models: H Haiku 4.5, S Sonnet 5, O Opus 5.5; with the skill 3 runs each; trigger counts are invocations.
- Cases: trigger-1 H 3/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; trigger-2 H 3/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; decoy-1 H 0/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; decoy-2 H 0/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; decoy-3 H 2/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; action-1 H 0/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; outcome-1 H 2/3 S 3/3 O 3/3.
- Tuning rounds 1 and 2: value cases rerun on all models with a 60-turn cap and full-reply judging; triggers of the ten skills whose descriptions changed rerun. Haiku 4.5 failures are mostly the skill not invoked (the model answers in one turn); after one description rewrite they are recorded, not tuned further. Worth (pooled with versus without): no CUT.
- FAIL decoy-3 · trigger · overtrigger · H 2/3 S 0/3 O 0/3
- FAIL action-1 · action · undertrigger (skill not invoked in 3 of 3 failing runs) · H 0/3 S 3/3 O 3/3
- FAIL outcome-1 · outcome · undertrigger (skill not invoked in 1 of 1 failing runs) · H 2/3 S 3/3 O 3/3
- led to: L-004, C-20261005-1

### T-20261004-2 · 2026-10-04 · evals/run_evals.py (claude -p --restricted, dontAsk, fresh folder on another drive) · windows/claude-code, Claude Code 2.1.281 · 4/7 cases on all three models
- Models: H Haiku 4.5, S Sonnet 5, O Opus 5.5; with the skill 3 runs each; trigger counts are invocations.
- Cases: trigger-1 H 2/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; trigger-2 H 3/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; decoy-1 H 0/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; decoy-2 H 0/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; decoy-3 H 2/3 S 0/3 O 0/3; action-1 H 0/3 S 3/3 O 3/3; outcome-1 H 0/3 S 0/3 O 3/3.
- First S6 matrix after three harness fixes (cine.py by any path, setup copies, deterministic checks); 155 runs that hit the account's session limit were run again.
- FAIL decoy-3 · trigger · overtrigger · H 2/3 S 0/3 O 0/3
- FAIL action-1 · action · undertrigger (skill not invoked in 3 of 3 failing runs) · H 0/3 S 3/3 O 3/3
- FAIL outcome-1 · outcome · wrong-outcome · H 0/3 S 0/3 O 3/3
- led to: L-003, C-20261004-2

### T-20261004-1 · 2026-10-04 · claude -p (Sonnet, headless, restricted scratch folder) · windows/claude-code · baselines only, 2 cases
- action-1 baseline: wrote its own cut list (cutlist.md, 1C only, 3.9 s), no check run, no reasons per cut; evidence absent. Not contaminated.
- outcome-1 baseline: trims right; scar fix by flipping the shot (breaks screen direction) or paint; no cutaway. Partly discriminates.
- Trigger, decoy and with-skill runs on three models are S6.
- led to: C-20261004-1
